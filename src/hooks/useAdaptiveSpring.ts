 * Returns Framer Motion spring presets calibrated to the current display.

 * Goals:
 *  - Critically damped (ratio ≥ 1.0) — settles without overshoot or ring.
 *  - restDelta / restSpeed as tight as possible — Framer exits the animation
 *    loop the moment motion is sub-pixel, freeing the compositor immediately.
 *  - Hi-DPI: stiffer + heavier damping because sub-pixel overshoot is
 *    more visible at 2× and the GPU fill-rate budget is tighter on 4K.
